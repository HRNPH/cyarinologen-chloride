#  cyarinologen-chloride
## Origin & Importance
Due to the lack of Charonium which is important for the Charian people just like food for average being,
normally charian people are able to get the Charonium from The P Characetyl co-A facebookpost.
we created cyarinologen-chloride for the Charian people, to incease the resource for Charonium.

# How to be Charian people
- Add cyarinologen-chloride AKA: image of P Characetyl co-A to the pcharian folders and named it to an interger number.
- Add Better description of the cyarinologen-chloride substances to the README.md file.
- Improve the function of cyarinologen-chloride but I'll not provide guidelines for this. Just read it yourself Lol.
